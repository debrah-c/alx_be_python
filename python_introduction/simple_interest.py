#First define the variables.
Simple Interest = "I"
Principal = "P" 
Rate = "R"
Time = "T"
I = "P * R * T"  #This is the formula of finding I which is the interest.
#Assign values to the variables
P = 1000
R = 0.05
T = 3
#Calculate the value of I using the formula: I = P * R * T
print("The simple interest is:", P * R * T)
